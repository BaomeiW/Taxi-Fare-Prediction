# **Taxi-Fare-Prediction**

# **Objective**

Design an algorithm that will tell the fare to be charged for a passenger.

# **Problem Statement Scenario**

A fare calculator helps a customer in identifying the fare valid for the trip. They are often used by passengers who are new to a city or tourists to get an estimate of the travel costs. You are provided with a dataset with features like fare amount, pickup and drop location, passenger count, and so on.
